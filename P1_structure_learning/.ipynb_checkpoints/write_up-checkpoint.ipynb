    "* This project is a competition to find Bayesian network structures that best fit some given data. The fitness of the structures will be measured by the Bayesian score (described in the course textbook DMU 2.4.1).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The bayesian network is widely used in data exploration. However, in some cases, we have bare knowledge about the relationships between variables in the dataset. To generate bayesian network, the structure learning algorithms have to be used to understand the relationships between each data node. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is using bayesian scoring method and some searching strategies to find out the structure which can explain the dataset in an appropriate manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "There are four dataset used in this project to evaluate the structure learning algorithm.\n",
    "* `titanic`: 8 variables 899 observations\n",
    "* `whitewine`: 12 variables 4898 observations\n",
    "* `schoolgrades`: 28 variables 2287 observations\n",
    "* `test`: 5 variables 1000 observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic methods I used in this project are Bayesian Structure Scoring and K2 Searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Structure Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of BS score is to find a diagram (denoted as `G`) which can maximizes `P(G|D)` where `D` is the given dataset. The equation are given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "  ![bs_function][image_bs_function] \n",
    "  \n",
    "where,\n",
    "  \n",
    "* `ri` is the number of instantiations of `Xi`\n",
    "  \n",
    "* `qi` is the number of instantiations of the parents of `Xi`\n",
    "  \n",
    "* `mijk` to represent the number of times `Xi = k` given `πij` in the dataset `D`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K2 Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "K2 is one of the most common search strategies. It start with a no directed edges diagram. And iterating over all the nodes by greedily adding the parents until the BS score won't increase by adding other parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shortcoming of this searching method is not guarantee finding a globally optimal since the initial diagram was random generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: The original K2 method assume the Dirichlet prior parameters `αijk = 1` for all `i`, `j`, and `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding scores and time used for generating the structure are listed below. The `Diagrams` are listed in the `appendix` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data          \t\t  | Runing time | Scores      |\n",
    "|:-----------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n",
    "| titanic         \t\t  | 0.56 s \t    |-3833.5      |\n",
    "| whitewine          \t  | 1.97 s      |-42128.0     |\n",
    "| schoolgrades\t\t\t  | 18.3 s\t    |-47381.8     |\n",
    "| test       \t\t\t  | 0.13 s\t    |-2220.2      |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the K2 algorithm, the bayesian structure which is generate from structure learing can be used to represent the dataset. For instance, the `titanic` structure shows both the `sex` and `passengerclass` are the parents of `survived`, which is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the shortcomings of my entire process are obviously. First, the K2 search will be trapped by `local optimal` rather than `globally optimal`. The result of the K2 search is highly depends on the initial random diagram and searching ordering. Also, the number of allowed parents for each node is another parameter based on the manual judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid local optimal problem, I think `Randomized Restart` and `Tabu Search` are the two possible methods to improve my results. \n",
